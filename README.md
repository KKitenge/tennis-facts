# Tennis Quiz

## Description
A short quiz with the aim to have a player presented with a set of multiple choice questions. Once one set is answered, the next question in the queue appears until the questions are all answered or time has run out. Incorrect answers are to be counted in the wrong column as well as have time deducted from the stop watch. Correct answers are to be added to the correct column and have no effect on time. The game is to end if the time runs out or the questions are all answered before then.

## Status

This project did not cross all the marks. The player is able to complete the quiz in the allotted time, however there were issues in retaining score information and displaying that at the end of the game.


## Usage
Access the live site at [Live Link](https://kkitenge.github.io/tennis-facts/) and proceed with the game.
